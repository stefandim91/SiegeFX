#!/usr/bin/env bash
# Runs a script inside a nested, virtual KWin session (with Xwayland), so
# nothing it starts appears on the desktop. The compositor gets private XDG
# dirs under <work dir>, so it never touches the real KDE configuration; the
# script restores the real ones itself if what it runs needs them.
#
#   tools/ds1/nested.sh <work dir> <timeout seconds> <script>
#
# Exit status is the compositor's (124 = timed out). KWin does not pass the
# session's exit code on, so scripts write their results to files. KWin's
# output goes to <work dir>/kwin.log.
#
# Never unset WAYLAND_DISPLAY inside the session: libwayland then falls back
# to "wayland-0", the REAL desktop, and a Wayland-first client (GLFW 3.4)
# opens its window there. To test an app's X11 path, keep WAYLAND_DISPLAY and
# set XDG_SESSION_TYPE=x11 (GLFW then connects to X11 only).
